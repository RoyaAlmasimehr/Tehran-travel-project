            <h2>Why Tehran?</h2>
            <h3>Tehran ,also has plenty of beautiful historical buildings</h3>
            <p>
              It may be surprising to find Tehran among Iran’s most beautiful
              cities. After all, Iran’s capital city has quite a chaotic
              architecture, traffic and is unfortunately famous for its
              pollution. Yet, Tehran can be a beautiful city for the visitor
              that takes the time to discover it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Enclosed by the mountains in the north, Tehran has many green
              boulevards and parks where it’s pleasant to walk. Moreover, Tehran
              also has plenty of beautiful historical buildings such as the
              Golestan Palace , Saad Abad Palace, Niavaran Palace and the
              buildings of Bagh Melli, which gives it a unique atmosphere.
